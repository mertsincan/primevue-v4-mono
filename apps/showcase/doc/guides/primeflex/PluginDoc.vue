            The <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwindcss-primeui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tailwindcss-primeui</a> is an official plugin by PrimeTek to provide first class integration between a Prime UI library like
            primevuelab and Tailwind CSS. It is designed to work both in styled and unstyled modes. For example, in styled mode the semantic colors such as primary and surfaces are provided as Tailwind utilities e.g. <i>bg-primary</i>,
            <i>text-surface-500</i>, <i>text-muted-color</i> by deriving their values from the design tokens. This integration is not compatible with primevuelab v3 and requires primevuelab v4.
