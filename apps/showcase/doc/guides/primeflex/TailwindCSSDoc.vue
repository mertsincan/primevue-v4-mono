            Tailwind CSS in particular is a popular choice, we have even built the <a href="https://tailwind.primevue-lab.org">Tailwind CSS presets</a> spin-off project for the unstyled mode to be able to use the utility classes to style the
            primevue-lab components. During this work, we've realized that the value added by PrimeFlex such as providing the primevue-lab theming as utility classes can be implemented as a Tailwind plugin. As part of primevue-lab v4, a
            tailwind-primeui plugin has been created for the seamless integration, the website templating demos have been migrated from PrimeFlex to Tailwind and a converter tool called <i>pf2tw</i> has been created. In summary, PrimeTek officially
            suggests Tailwind CSS as the replacement for PrimeFlex.
